# Fries and PhoneGap

[Fries] is an awesome mobile development framework (yes, not just for prototyping!) 
for Android apps using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript and was inspired by [Ratchet].
We all know that you can find loads of iOS development tools out there, 
so this time let's give some love to Android.


### What's this?

This Android project is a demo of how you can integrate Fries with [PhoneGap].
It's pretty straightforward since you just have to copy your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files 
into the `/assets/www/` directory and run your application.

__Note:__ Make sure the paths to the Fries components in your HTML files are correct
to get it to work.


### How to run this

To run this project:

1. Download a copy of the reposity and unzip
2. Launch your Eclipse IDE
3. Import the project into Eclipse by going to File > New > Other > Android > Android Project from Existing Code
4. Choose the folder where you unzipped the demo
5. Click 'Finish'
6. Then just run the app
