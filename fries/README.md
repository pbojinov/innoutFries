# Fries

Fries is an awesome mobile development framework (yes, not just for prototyping!) 
for Android apps using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript and was inspired by [Ratchet].
We all know that you can find loads of iOS development tools out there, 
so this time let's give some love to Android.


### Update: June 11, 2013
I won't be accepting pull requests to version `1.0.0` as its features are already 
pretty much set in stone. Please have a look at branch `wip-1.0.1` and contribute there.
And please follow the [Contributing] guide that I made.


### What's New In Version 1.0.0

The initial push of Fries was generally made to see how the community would react
to something like this. And I've seen great feedback so I think Fries needed a
major overhaul. A lot of things were missing in the previous version and
version 1.0.0 is a huge step from that.

Here's a list of new things in version 1.0.0:

* Fries is now optimized for PhoneGap.
* Added Android-like page transitions using `stack.js` (based on Ratchet's push.js).
Since push.js is optimized for iOS-like transitions, I found it unsuitable to be
used in Fries. `stack.js` mimics the page transitions in Android using CSS3 transforms
and oh, did I mention it works smoothly?
* Your pages should now be wrapped in `.page` class for `stack.js` to work.
* Added bottom-positioned action bars and evenly spaced out action buttons using flex-box layout mode.
* Not using input[type=*] selectors to style input elements anymore. Input elements 
are now styled using classes (.input-text, etc). This was done so that the form elements
can still be styled easily using custom CSS.
* Reworked tabs. Added tab content transition and active tab highlighting. Added `tabs.js`.
* Removed iScroll dependency, sadly. iScroll works like the native iOS so again, 
I found it unsuitable for Fries. You can still use it if you want to though.
* Reworked `action-bars.js` and `spinner.js` as the previous versions attach multiple
event handlers causing unexpected results.
* Fries now uses the official Android icons. Thanks to [Tobias Bieniek] for this [awesome icon font].


## Getting Started

Fries is now optimized to run as a PhoneGap app. I found it hard to optimize on the mobile
browser because of a few reasons:

* There's no way to remove the browser's navigation bar except by adding a few pixels
of padding on the bottom of the page. (Correct me if I'm wrong)
* Adobe Edge Inspect (which I use for testing) renders differently from the mobile
browser.
* It appears that there's an issue with the mobile browser's line-height property.
If you check out the examples on your Android device's mobile browser, the text are
slightly off-center vertically.

Now with all that said, head on over to the [demo project] to see how to setup your first
Fries app.


## Performance

Surprisingly, Fries works well with PhoneGap. I didn't expect the CSS transitions
to be this fast. Check out this [test video] that I made to show how a Fries app looks
on PhoneGap. Although there are still glitches (like the black lines that appear on
pop screen transition), I think Fries still does great for an HTML5 mobile app.


## Development Roadmap

Fries aims to make Android apps fast and easy using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
In the long run, these are the following features and components that I think 
should be added to Fries:

* Scrollable Tabs
* Modals
* Other Form Elements
* Shelf Menus (a la Facebook or Path style menu)
* Loading Indicator
* Custom Scroller (iScroll is great but Fries aims to be as close to an Android app as possible)
* Typography
* Theming using LESS or SASS
* Automatic resizing of the action bars and tabs on landscape view. In a typical
Android app, the action bars and tabs resizes to 40px from the default 48px.


## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank [Dave Gamache], [Connor Sears], and [Jacob Thornton] for a wonderful job on [Ratchet].
The conversion of the official Android icons was done in [IcoMoon].
